			<p>
				I'm just a regular dragon who likes to code and make websites (mostly)!
				<br />
				More precisely though, I'm swiss computer science student who
				is a huge fan of dergs, which is why I made my sona one!
				<br />
				It's a bit hard to describe myself, but I'll try my best!
				<br />
				I'm a nightwing, which is a race that comes from the book series "Wings of Fire".
				<br />
				I like programming in rust, typescript, javascript and c++.
				<br />
				That's all I can think of for now, but I'll update this page when I think of
				something else!
				<br />
				<br />
				See you around!
